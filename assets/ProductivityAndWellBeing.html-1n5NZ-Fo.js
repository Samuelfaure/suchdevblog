Most of this should work for you too, and it will work particularly well in a remote work setting.</p><h2 id="introduction" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction"><span>Introduction</span></a></h2><p>Some people think more productivity means less well-being. Those people are wrong. They might be victims of management structures that do not understand the fundamental truth of intellectual work:</p><p><strong>Your productivity is a direct byproduct of your well-being;</strong></p><p><strong>Your well-being tends to increase when you&#39;re productive</strong> (up to a point).</p><p>By taking care of yourself, you are fulfilling your duties both to yourself and to your employer.</p><h2 id="step-one-setting-your-priorities-straight" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-one-setting-your-priorities-straight"><span>Step One: Setting your priorities straight</span></a></h2><p>Do a quick categorization of what are the most important things in your life right now. Here&#39;s mine:</p><p>1/ Health 2/ Family and closest friends 3/ Work</p><p>If your health and close relationships aren&#39;t on top, please ask yourself why that is, and what the consequences of such a choice could mean for your future.</p><p>Now that we agreed about your priorities, we can start the process.</p><h2 id="step-two-life-hygiene" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-two-life-hygiene"><span>Step Two: Life Hygiene</span></a></h2><p>We&#39;re stating the obvious in that one, but the obvious often bears repeating.</p><h3 id="physical-exercise" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#physical-exercise"><span>Physical exercise</span></a></h3><p>This is <strong>NOT</strong> optional.</p><p>Not only does your health need it, it will increase your mood and your focus.</p><h3 id="sleep" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sleep"><span>Sleep</span></a></h3><p>This is literally how your brain learns things. If you don&#39;t have a good sleep schedule, absolutely prioritize working on that issue.</p><h3 id="posture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#posture"><span>Posture</span></a></h3><p>Back pains suck. They really do. And let&#39;s be clear: if you want a career in programming, you WILL have back pain issues if you don&#39;t work on it. If you don&#39;t already know the 101 of correct posture, google it right after reading this article (or better, ask ChatGPT).</p><p>So you should maintain a correct posture while sitting, right? Well, yes, but it won&#39;t be enough for most people. You will probably still end up with bad back pains.</p><p>A standing desk can be life-changing. It will also not be enough; you will want a solution where you can alternate between sitting and standing, for two reasons:</p><ul><li>Standing all day can be very hard when you first start.</li><li>Standing all day can bring about as many issues as sitting all day.</li></ul><p>Before anything, take regular breaks and move around. Alternate postures as much as possible. <strong>The best posture is your next posture</strong>.</p><p>Finally, if all of this is not enough (and I suspect for many of you it won&#39;t be), learn Yoga. A daily deep yogi muscle relaxation is the most powerful tool there is against back pain.</p><h4 id="bonus-yoga-crash-course" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#bonus-yoga-crash-course"><span>Bonus: Yoga Crash Course</span></a></h4><p>Lay down on the floor on your back. Inhale 5 to 7 seconds in, hold for 2, exhale for 9 seconds. Try to relax your body as much as possible. Do this 10 mins everyday. Congratulations, you&#39;re doing Yoga.</p><h3 id="food" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#food"><span>Food</span></a></h3><p>Please don&#39;t underestimate how much what you&#39;re eating can make you feel like shit.</p><p>Before devoting my life to code, I used to work as a food scientist. I can sum up years of research about what you should probably be eating, in the form of a haiku:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-highlighter="prismjs" data-ext="text"><pre><code class="language-text"><span class="line">Bit of everything,</span>
<span class="line">But mostly vegetables.</span>

Do take care of that.</p><p>The single most important advice I have on this topic is to get outside, first thing in the morning, for about 10 minutes. The morning light entering your eyes will tune your internal clock to the &quot;morning&quot; setting.</p><p>For more tips on this topic, and as a general amazing resource for science-based tools for your well-being, I recommend the entirety of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b6bwcWK6GE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Huberman Podcast</a>.</p><h2 id="step-three-focusing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-three-focusing"><span>Step Three: Focusing</span></a></h2><h3 id="noise-cancelling-headphones" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#noise-cancelling-headphones"><span>Noise-cancelling headphones</span></a></h3><p>They will be of tremendous help to you if you can&#39;t focus with sounds around you (or without music). If you work in an open space, that might even be mandatory.</p><p>Choose a model that you can wear for long hours without any pain (you&#39;re not working hard to avoid back pains just to end up with head pains). Sony&#39;s WH-1000 XM4 are a solid choice if you can afford them.</p><h3 id="be-by-yourself-or-don-t" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#be-by-yourself-or-don-t"><span>Be by yourself. Or don&#39;t</span></a></h3><p>Some people work better alone in a room. Some people work better when other people are present. If you can afford a choice here, try and see what works for you.</p><h3 id="the-pomodoro-technique" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pomodoro-technique"><span>The Pomodoro technique</span></a></h3><p>Many guides exist on that topic, so I won&#39;t go into details. The gist of it is to work in cycles of 50 minutes + 10 minute breaks.</p><p>During those 50 minutes of work, you should practice <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25744928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep work</a>. Absolutely no distraction, work on your focus.</p><p>During those 10 minute breaks, I highly recommend that you <strong>stretch</strong>.</p><p>I am not kidding when I say that the Pomodoro technique is the most important productivity tool for remote work.</p><p>Although the pomodoro technique works extremely well for some people, many of them end up not using it anyway. <a href="https://suchdevblog.com/opinions/WhyOurWorkCultureSucks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Knowing something works and not doing it anyway is a classic problem</a>. Don&#39;t be like this: if something works for you, persevere.</p><p>Sidenote: the opposite is also true. If something doesn&#39;t work for you, absolutely do not persevere as it, but change something.</p><h3 id="stimulants" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#stimulants"><span>Stimulants</span></a></h3><p>Coffee works great if you use it with moderation, as long as it&#39;s not disrupting your sleep.</p><h3 id="a-big-screen-or-two" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-big-screen-or-two"><span>A Big Screen Or two</span></a></h3><p>Many companies researched how to boost productivity for their employees. Apparently, the only two things that they found worked were: Coffee, and bigger screens.</p><p>If you&#39;re working on a small laptop screen, consider investing in at least one bigger screen.</p><h2 id="step-four-making-space" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-four-making-space"><span>Step Four: Making Space</span></a></h2><h3 id="cleaning-your-environment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cleaning-your-environment"><span>Cleaning your environment</span></a></h3><p>&lt;&lt; A clean space is a clean mind &gt;&gt;. When your head is a mess, your environment is a mess. When your environment is a mess, your head is a mess.</p><p>This applies both to real life and to your virtual environment: files everywhere on your computer are increasing your mental load as well. Clean your spaces, including your desktop, including the one inside your computer.</p><h3 id="cleaning-your-head" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cleaning-your-head"><span>Cleaning your head</span></a></h3><p>If you&#39;re not managing your stress, you&#39;re not managing your head.</p><p>A regular meditation practice will not only help you focus better by directly training your focus skills, but will also clear your head of the unnecessary clutter.</p><h3 id="cleaning-your-code" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cleaning-your-code"><span>Cleaning your code</span></a></h3><p>Having technical debt is really bad for your productivity, but also for your well-being. <a href="https://suchdevblog.com/opinions/TechnicalDebtKitchen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here&#39;s an article explaining why.</a>. So work on your technical debt. Keep it as small as possible</p><p>A great method to clean your space - virtual, mental, and code - is the Marie Kondo philosophy. Throw things away.

And I&#39;m in it. We keep preaching this methodology for a good reason: it <strong>works</strong>.</p><p>It&#39;s actually extremely hard to practice TDD well; just like the game of Go, you can know the rules yet still suck at it. It takes years and years of practice to actually do well.</p><p>When you suck at TDD, it still saves you time on the middle and long-term. When you&#39;re good at TDD, it also saves you time on the short term.</p><h3 id="atomic-git-commits" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#atomic-git-commits"><span>Atomic Git Commits</span></a></h3><p>Please refer to <a href="https://suchdevblog.com/lessons/AtomicGitCommits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my article on the topic.</a></p><h3 id="ai-is-your-friend" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ai-is-your-friend"><span>AI is your friend</span></a></h3><p>Artificial Intelligence will probably not replace us in the near future, but using AI will definitely boost your productivity by an order of magnitude. I&#39;m not sponsored by Github but I&#39;ll say it anyway: 10 dollars a month for Copilot is more than worth it.</p><p>And don&#39;t be afraid to ask ChatGPT immediately when you don&#39;t know something. AI is the new Google.</p><p>And while this article was not written by ChatGPT, most of my automated tests at work mostly are. Just copy-paste your class, ask for some tests, and 80% of the work is done.</p><h2 id="step-six-don-t-overdo-it" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#step-six-don-t-overdo-it"><span>Step Six: Don&#39;t Overdo It</span></a></h2><p>The problem with an increased productivity is that you&#39;ll be able to work a lot.</p><p>The problem with working a lot is that you might end up working too much.</p><p>The problem with working too much is that you&#39;ll end up harming your well-being, hence your productivity.</p><p>A note about deep work: deep work is much, much more intense than non-deep work. You probably cannot produce 8 hours of your best code every day without burning out real fast.</p><p>Manage yourself, respect yourself, this is a marathon not a sprint.</p><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2><p>If you implement everything we discussed here, not only will you be a more productive person, you&#39;ll also be significantly happier.
