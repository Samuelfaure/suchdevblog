But troubleshooting is <em>hard</em>. Here are the main issues and how to fix them :</p><h2 id="halp-solr-returns-no-results" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#halp-solr-returns-no-results"><span>Halp, Solr returns no results !</span></a></h2><p>Did you build your index ? Try <code>RAILS_ENV=your_env bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:reindex</code>. Server should be started for this operation. Always put RAILS_ENV at the beginning of the command.</p><h2 id="halp-i-have-error-500-rsolr-error-connectionrefused" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#halp-i-have-error-500-rsolr-error-connectionrefused"><span>Halp, I have error 500 - RSolr::Error::ConnectionRefused !</span></a></h2><p>Did you wait long enough for Solr to initialize ? Usually, 3 seconds after running <code>rake sunspot:solr:start</code> is enough, but if you&#39;re working on a VM like travis-ci or circle-ci, it might be slower. I put a <code>sleep:30</code> command after launching Solr, which slows down my build 30 seconds but then Solr has enough time to launch.</p><p>This might also be a problem of conflicts between different Solr servers. Try killing your Solr processes and launch it again. Sometimes the java VM stays active, you might need to kill it too.</p><p>If it still doesn&#39;t work and you have a write.lock file in your index, try deleting it.</p><h2 id="halp-i-have-error-503-rsolr-error-connectionrefused" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#halp-i-have-error-503-rsolr-error-connectionrefused"><span>Halp, I have error 503 - RSolr::Error::ConnectionRefused !</span></a></h2><p>Did you start your server ?</p><p>No, really, did you ? Sunspot might tell you it is launched, but it is sometimes a lie. To know if it launched, you can run <code>RAILS_ENV=your_env bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:run</code>. This should launch it in the shell, so you will see if it crashes or not. Or, just run <code>RAILS_ENV=your_env bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start</code>. If it tells you that it launched correctly the second time, then it isn&#39;t launching correctly at all.</p><h2 id="halp-i-have-error-404-rsolr-error-http-404-not-found" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#halp-i-have-error-404-rsolr-error-http-404-not-found"><span>Halp, I have error 404 - RSolr::Error::Http - 404 Not Found !</span></a></h2><p>Usually, this is due to files missing. Check your /solr/ folder, in Rails root. Check if you do have the <code>solr/your_env/core.properties</code> file as well as the <code>solr/your_env/data</code> folder. More importantly, check they are correctly copied wherever you are running your Solr.</p><h2 id="halp-nothing-worked" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#halp-nothing-worked"><span>Halp, nothing worked !</span></a></h2><p>The solution that works 90% of the time is a good ol&#39; kill-and-restart. Get the PID with <code>ps aux | grep solr</code> then <code>kill PID</code>. Relaunching the server with <code>RAILS_ENV=your_env bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start</code> is usually enough. As said before, the java VM might still be active, you might need to kill it too, but it will show when you run <code>ps aux | grep solr</code>.</p><p>One last thing : if you&#39;re allocating a fixed memory size to Solr, this might be the issue. Try different values. Allocating too much memory might cause some trouble.</p><p>Hope it worked for you !
