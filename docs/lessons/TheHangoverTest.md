# 🍻 Does your Pull Request pass the Hangover test?

This is a short reminder about what Programming is.

Programming has and will always be about reducing complexity first and foremost.

If you ask a coworker to review your pull request, always ask yourself: does it pass the Hangover test?

Can your coworker turn on his computer after having drank too much the previous evening and still be able to understand your code with minimal effort?

It's always easy to write complex code on a good day. Complexity is easy to write; simplicity is not. Just because you had an easy time writing it on that day doesn't mean it's simple enough for someone else to understand it on a bad day.

Because you don't write code for writing it, you write it for it to be read - it will be written once but read 50 times or more.

If you're not writing for Hangover Coworker, you're making your life -and the life of every colleague, present and future- harder.

Remember that complex code is not a sign of intelligence, it's a sign of sloppiness.

So can someone kill their brain cells with too much alcohol and the next morning still make sense of your code with relative ease?

If not, back to the drawing board 🔁 Make it better until it passes the Hangover test.
