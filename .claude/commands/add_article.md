Here is an article I wrote. Format it in a style that is consistent with the other articles in the repository. You can read the other articles for reference.

Choose the category it belongs to and place it in the appropriate folder. Also update docs/.vuepress/config.js to include the new article in the sidebar, and the appropriate index file at the root of the docs/ folder.
Every article title starts with an emoji, use one that is appropriate.

Be sure to include in the article the "title, description, footer" section like in other articles in the repository. The footer never change.
